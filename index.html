									<p>For my final year project I was able to develop a virtual pet game with the target of the game being young children.<br /> 
										The goal of the game is  to teach children to understand pet care through the guidance of a vet character who will provide 
										help to progress through the game and educational information on the topics surrounding pet care. <br /> 
									The game includes customisation features such as choosing a name for the pet and Three playable levels which the player can interact with the goal of the game being is to keep a certain number of needs meters up to keep the pet healthy and happy. <br />
									The levels contain various mini games based on important aspects of pet care such as affection, diet and exercise in order to convey how the acts of pet care can be carried out and how they function in a way that is entertaining and engaging to the players.</p>

									<p>For this project myself and a group were tasked with creating a home Environmental Monitoring system which has the ability to read environmental data from the atmosphere, such as temperature and humidity, and display to the user through a series of coloured lights if the current temperature and humidity of the environment was in a specified range, if the temperature was out of range, if the humidity was out of range or if both temperature and humidity were recorded to be out of range.</p>

									<p>This project is a rec website which allows users to log in as a chef or a regular user who will each has different aspects of the website they will have access to depending on their login. For example, users with chief accounts are able to create new recipes that can be added to the website through a database. This a feature regular users do not have access to.</p>
